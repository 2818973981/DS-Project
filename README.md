# DS-Project
1. Project Overview
This app combines the functionalities of a restaurant recommendation system with a social media platform. Users can not only discover restaurants through advanced filtering features but also participate in a foodie community to share dining experiences, recipes, and tips.

2. Key Features
Restaurant Search and Filter Functions:
- Offers detailed filtering options, including cuisine type (e.g., Italian, Japanese, Chinese), price range, distance, and ratings.
- Displays ratings directly on the search page, simplifying the process of checking restaurant details.
- Recommends restaurants based on proximity and user ratings, helping users make faster decisions.

Social Media Features:
- Features a dedicated social page where users can share their dining experiences.
- Users can upload photos of the food they ordered and write about their experiences, making it easier for others to discover new places.
- Posts include direct links to restaurant profiles, enabling users to learn more about places they see in their feed.
- This social page is not limited to restaurant recommendations; users can share recipes, dietary advice, cooking techniques, and more.

Data-Driven Personalization:
- Uses big data to personalize recommendations based on user preferences, browsing history, and social activity, suggesting restaurants, recipes, and trending food posts.
- Users receive dining suggestions tailored to their location, preferred cuisines, and price range.

3. User Journey
Step 1: Browse the Social Feed
Users can explore community posts that showcase other users' dining experiences, food photos, recipes, and tips. Posts that interest the user can be clicked to navigate directly to restaurant profiles or other relevant pages.
Step 2: Discover Restaurants
On the homepage, users can apply filters to search for specific types of restaurants (by cuisine type, price range, etc.). After filtering, a list of suitable restaurants with ratings will be displayed. Users can click on a restaurant for more details, including its menu, reviews, and location.
Step 3: Engage with Content
Users can interact with posts by liking, commenting, and following others with similar tastes. They can also share their own dining experiences, recipe ideas, and cooking tips with the community.
